# spotify-data-analysis-preCOVID-vs-afterCOVID
I created three datasets to analyze and compare the music trends as well as changes in terms of experiments.

I aim to explore the 'aesthetic of convergence,' which centers around the idea of cultural homogenization. To this end, I have gathered a comprehensive dataset from Spotify and self-made some from a couple of playlists, incorporating various features to facilitate a nuanced examination of the pertinent research questions:

"What will be the formula to create a hit song?" "How long should an average track last according to today's standards?" "Music listening behaviors pre-COVID vs after-COVID"

Through this exploration, I aim to contribute to a deeper comprehension of the interplay between artistic expression, commercial interests, and societal trends in the context of the modern music industry.
