# Spotify-data-analysis-preCOVID-vs-afterCOVID
I created three datasets to analyze and compare the music trends as well as changes in terms of experiments.

I aim to explore the 'aesthetic of convergence,' which centers around the idea of cultural homogenization. To this end, I have gathered a comprehensive dataset from Spotify and self-made some from a couple of playlists, incorporating various features to facilitate a nuanced examination of the pertinent research questions:

"What will be the formula to create a hit song?" "How long should an average track last according to today's standards?" "Music listening behaviors pre-COVID vs after-COVID"

Through this exploration, I aim to contribute to a deeper comprehension of the interplay between artistic expression, commercial interests, and societal trends in the context of the modern music industry.

# Understanding features of a song in Spotify Dataset

Instrumentalness: This value represents the amount of vocals in the song. The closer it is to 1.0, the more instrumental the song is.

Acousticness: This value describes how acoustic a song is. A score of 1.0 means the song is most likely to be an acoustic one.

Liveness: This value describes the probability that the song was recorded with a live audience. According to the official documentation “a value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live”.

Speechiness: “Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track”. If the speechiness of a song is above 0.66, it is probably made of spoken words, a score between 0.33 and 0.66 is a song that may contain both music and words, and a score below 0.33 means the song does not have any speech.

Energy: “(energy) represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy”.

Danceability: “Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable”.

Valence: “A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)”.

Loudness: pretty self-explanatory.

Energy: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.

Tempo: The pulse (BPM) of a song.
